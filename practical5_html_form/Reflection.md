 By using a variety of input types, such as text, date, and radio buttons, the form ensures that each piece of information is gathered in an appropriate format.
 However, there are some areas for improvement:

Input Consistency: Adding id attributes to each input field and matching them with for attributes in labels would enhance accessibility and make the form more user-friendly.
Field Type Adjustments: Changing the "Password" field to type="password" would improve security by hiding input characters.
Form Validation: Adding basic validation (like required attributes) could ensure users complete each necessary field before submission.
Button Labeling: Renaming the "Summit" button to "Submit" and providing an id could improve clarity and usability.

Overall, this form serves as a solid foundation, and these improvements would make it more accessible, secure, and user-friendly.
