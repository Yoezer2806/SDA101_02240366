This HTML code displays a simple "Grade Record" table listing students' first names, last names, student numbers, and grades. The table structure is organized with <tr> tags for rows and <th> for headers, ensuring the data is clear and easy to read.

An external CSS file (table.css) is linked to style the table, helping control layout and design. This separation of HTML and CSS keeps the code clean and maintainable.
