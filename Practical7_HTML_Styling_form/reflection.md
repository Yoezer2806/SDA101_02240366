This HTML form, styled with style.css, is designed to submit maintenance requests for a hostel. The form includes fields for name, room number, issue type, description, and urgency level, along with a submit button.

Strengths
Clear Purpose: The form is specifically designed for maintenance requests, with labeled fields that guide the user through providing necessary information.

Required Fields: The use of the required attribute ensures that essential fields are filled out before 
submission.

Simple Layout: The form elements are organized neatly, making it easy for users to navigate and complete.

Areas for Improvement

Input Consistency: Adding id attributes and matching for attributes in labels would improve accessibility and usability.

Button Functionality: The button has a typo in type="sumit" which should be corrected to type="submit" for proper form submission.

Urgency Field: Replacing the "urgency" textarea with a dropdown (e.g., "Low," "Medium," "High") could improve clarity and control user input.

Overall, this form is functional and clearly organized, but adding these enhancements would improve accessibility, usability, and input consistency.
